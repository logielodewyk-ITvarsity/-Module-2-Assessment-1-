                            <h3>LION</h3>
                            <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. 
                               It's fur varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red and dark brown. 
                              The colours of the underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark spots, which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts.</p>
                            <p>Adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.</p>
                             <p>Males have broader heads and a prominent mane that grows downwards and backwards covering most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest.</p>
                            <p>The male lion's mane is the most recognisable feature of the species.It may have evolved around 320,000â€“190,000 years ago. It starts growing when lions are about a year old.</p>
                            <p>The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight.</p>
                            <p>Lions spend much of their time resting; they are inactive for about twenty hours per day. Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming and defecating.</p>
                            <p>Groups of male lions are called "coalitions".Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females.</p>
