                            <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                            <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25 and 1.8 metres, weights between 100 and 270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 metres, depending on species and sex. They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. 
                            The Eastern gorilla is distinguished from the Western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 35–40 years in the wild.</p>
                            <p>Wild male gorillas weigh 136 to 227 kg (300 to 500 lb), while adult females weigh 68–113 kg (150–250 lb) Adult males are 1.4 to 1.8 m (4 ft 7 in to 5 ft 11 in) tall, with an arm span that stretches from 2.3 to 2.6 m (7 ft 7 in to 8 ft 6 in). Female gorillas are shorter at 1.25 to 1.5 m (4 ft 1 in to 4 ft 11 in), with smaller arm spans.</p>
                            <p>Adult male gorillas are known as silverbacks due to the characteristic silver hair on their backs reaching to the hips</p>
                            <p>The eastern gorilla is more darkly coloured than the western gorilla, with the mountain gorilla being the darkest of all. 
                            The mountain gorilla also has the thickest hair.</p>
                            The western lowland gorilla can be brown or greyish with a reddish forehead</p>
                            <p>In addition, gorillas that live in lowland forest are more slender and agile than the more bulky mountain gorillas. The eastern gorilla also has a longer face and broader chest than the western gorilla. Like humans, gorillas have individual fingerprints. Their eye colour is dark brown, framed by a black ring around the iris.</p>
