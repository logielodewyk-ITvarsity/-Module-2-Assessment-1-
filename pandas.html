                            <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                            <p>The giant panda also known as the panda bear (or simply the panda), is a bear species native to China.</p>
                            <p>It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body.</p>
                            <p>The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda.</p>
                            <p>The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China.</p>
                            <p>The giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, limbs and shoulders.</p>
                             <p>The rest of the animal's coat is white. The bear's distinctive coat appears to serve as camouflage in both winter and summer environments.</p> <p>The white areas may serve as camouflage in snow, while the black shoulders and legs provide crypsis in shade.</p>
                            <p>The giant panda typically lives around 20 years in the wild and up to 30 years in captivity.</p>
                            <p>Pandas eat any of 25 bamboo species in the wild; Bamboo leaves contain the highest protein levels; stems have less.</p>
                            <p>Pandas will travel between different habitats if they need to, so they can get the nutrients that they need and to balance their diet for reproduction.</p>
