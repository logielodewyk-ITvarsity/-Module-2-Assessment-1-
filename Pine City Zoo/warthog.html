                            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                            <p>The common warthog is a wild member of the pig family found in grassland, savanna, and woodland in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
                            <p> A warthog is identifiable by the two pairs of tusks protruding from the mouth and curving upwards.</p>
                             <p>The lower pair, which is far shorter than the upper pair, becomes razor-sharp by rubbing against the upper pair every time the mouth is opened and closed.</p>
                            <p>A tusk will curve 90° or more from the root, and will not lie flat on a table, as it curves somewhat backwards as it grows. The tusks are not used for digging, but are used for combat with other hogs, and in defense against predators – the lower set can inflict severe wounds.</p>
                            <p>The head of the common warthog is large, with a mane down the spine to the middle of the back. Sparse hair covers the body. Its color is usually black or brown. Tails are long and end with a tuft of hair.</p>
                            <p>Warthogs are powerful diggers, using both their snouts and feet.</p>
                            <p>Common warthogs will wallow in mud to cope with high temperatures and huddle together to cope with low temperatures.</p>
