                            <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                            <p>Monkeys are highly social animals, and almost all live in troops consisting of several females with young and either a single male.</p>
                            <p>The females stay in the troop in which they were born and are thus closely related to each other. Males join new troops on maturity, and so they are unrelated to each other.</p>
                            <p>Monkeys are arranged into two main groups: Old World and New World.</p>
                            <p>Old World monkeys all belong to one family; The New World monkeys are a group five families.</p>
                            <p>New World (“flat-nosed”) and Old World (downward-nosed”) monkeys are distinguished by the form of the nose.</p>
                            <p>Their hands and feet are both used for grasping and typically have five digits, the thumb and big toe being divergent from the others.</p>
                            <p>On the ground, monkeys walk with the entire sole of the foot touching the ground but with the palm of the hand raised. They almost never walk on two legs and can stand up straight for only short periods.</p>
                            <p>Monkeys have large brains and are known for their inquisitiveness and intelligence.</p>
                            <p>Most are good at solving complex problems and learning from experience.</p>
