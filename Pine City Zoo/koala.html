                            <h3>KOALA</h3>

                            <p>The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear is native to Australia. he koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions</p>
                            <p>It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb). Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south</p>
                            <p>Koalas typically inhabit open Eucalyptus woodland, the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day</p>
                            <p>The koala has one of the smallest brains in proportion to body weight of any mammal. Because of its small brain, the koala has a limited ability to perform complex, unfamiliar behaviours. For example, when presented with plucked leaves on a flat surface, the animal cannot adapt to the change in its normal feeding routine and will not eat the leaves.</p>
                            <p>Its nose is fairly large and covered in leathery skin. Its round ears provide it with good hearing, and it has a well-developed middle ear. A koala's vision is not well developed, and its relatively small eyes are unusual among marsupials in that the pupils have vertical slits.Koalas make use of a novel vocal organ to produce low-pitched sounds</p>
