                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>

                            <p>The giraffe is a tall African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth.</p>
                            <p>The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its spotted coat patterns</p>
                            <p>The giraffe has an extremely elongated neck, which can be up to 2.4 m (7.9 ft) in length.[56] Along the neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs.[8] The neck typically rests at an angle of 50â€“60 degrees, though juveniles have straighter necks and rest at 70 degrees.</p>
                            <p>Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear sole responsibility for raising the young.</p>
                            <p>Giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves, but estimates as of 2016 indicate there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010</p>

                            <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
