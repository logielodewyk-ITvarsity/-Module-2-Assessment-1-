                            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                            <p>The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. 
                                t is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, such as the Kalahari Desert. 
                                Some authorities formerly included the East African oryx as a subspecies</p>
                                <p>Gemsbok are found at elevations from 900 to 1,200 meters, in wooded grasslands as well as wetter grasslands. 
                                They can survive in areas of low productivity. Gemsbok prefer stony plains with at least limited water access, but can subsist in areas of dunes, rocky mountainous areas, and arid habitats with little seasonal water. 
                                Gemsbok also frequent open areas more than areas with increased tree density</p>
                                <p>Black markings on the face extend down from the base of the horns to above the muzzle, and sweep back in stripes over the eyes and cheeks.
                                 Black continues down the neck and around the underbody, forming bands around all four legs. A stripe also runs up the spine, starting at the tip of the tail and ending at a short thick mane of black. There are black markings on the front of all four legs. The lower portion of the legs, muzzle, and underbelly are all white, whereas the body and neck are a gray or tan color. 
                                In instances of high productivity grazing, fat deposits under the skin become noticeable.</p>
